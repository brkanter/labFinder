Is there a map of research universities? I couldn't find one, so I'm working on making one (still in beta). Hopefully this will help academics find their next home by visualizing the possibilities.

Browse around, click on pins, follow the links to university websites and check out what they have to offer.

To do:
  * Expand list of universities beyond R1 and beyond the United States.
  * Restrict to neuroscience/neurobiology research, or somehow label by subject matter.
  * Try to incorporate open positions / hiring information.

Please get in touch with suggestions and feedback.
