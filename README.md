Is there a map of research universities? I couldn't find one, so I'm working on making one (still in beta). Hopefully this will help academics find their next home by visualizing the possibilities.

Browse around, click on pins, follow the links to university websites and check out what they have to offer.

To do:
  * Add missing information (eg. websites).

Notes:
  * Blue = Carnegie R1 rating, Red = Carnegie R2 rating, Orange = ALBA network, Purple = manually added

Please get in touch with suggestions and feedback.
