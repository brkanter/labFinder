Is there a map of research universities? I couldn't find one, so I'm working on making one (still in beta). Hopefully this will help academics find their next home by visualizing the possibilities.

Browse around, click on pins, follow the links to university websites and check out what they have to offer.

To do:
  * Expand list of institutes.
  * Restrict to neuroscience/neurobiology research, or somehow label by subject matter.
  * Try to incorporate open positions / hiring information.

Notes:
  * Blue = R1 rating, Red = R2 rating, Purple = Outside USA
  * Marker size scales with NIH 2019 funding for USA.

Please get in touch with suggestions and feedback.
